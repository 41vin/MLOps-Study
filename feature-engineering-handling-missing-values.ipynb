For example, in a dataset of height and age, there will be more missing values in the age column because girls are not comfortable talking about their age.Â Similarly, if we prepare a dataset for predicting an employee's salary that includes columns like experience and salary, the salary column will have more missing values because most people do not want to share information about their salary. In a bigger scenario where we are preparing data for a large population, some diseases, people who died in an accident, the number of taxpayers inside a city, etc. People participating in all these and similar scenarios usually hesitate to put down their personal information and sometimes hide the real numbers. Even if you download the data from a third-party resource, there is still some chance of missing values due to some corruption in the file while downloading."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### **Why Handle Missing Values ?**\n","* Many machine learning algorithms faild to perform on the dataset if it contains missing values. However there are some algorithms that works even with missing values like K-nearest neighbours and Naive Bayes.\n","\n","* You may end up building a biased model that will lead to incorrect results.\n","* Missing values reduces accuracy of the model.\n","* Missing values can lead to less precision."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Sample Datasets & Libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","titanic = pd.read_csv ('drive/MyDrive/Titanic-Dataset.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-19T17:10:51.503176Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-19T17:10:51.502755Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.789652Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.788338Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-19T17:10:51.503149Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["before imputing missing values let's see how to find missing values inside dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Checking For Missing Values Inside The Dataset**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.791522Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.791038Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.806609Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.805604Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-19T17:10:52.791482Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["PassengerId      0\n","Survived         0\n","Pclass           0\n","Name             0\n","Sex              0\n","Age            177\n","SibSp            0\n","Parch            0\n","Ticket           0\n","Fare             0\n","Cabin          687\n","Embarked         2\n","dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["## 1.
